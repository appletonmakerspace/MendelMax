#DHMN's MendelMax 1.5

![picture](http://github.com/dhmn/MendelMax/blob/master/mm15_model.png?raw=true "model")

This is all of the parts on the group MendelMax in one place and model.  Useful for modeling new parts.

80% of the parts are from the upstream MendelMax design, 10% from Mark Finn, 10% are from others.

The full openscad model is in mm15_model.scad. Everything else is a part on my machine (but not necessarily my design).

The model is not entirely done yet, but still useful. This project has an upstream of Mark's MendelMax, so we can pull updates as I improve the model.

##Todo (currently matching upstream Mark's todo list):
* switch arduino mount to scad use<> instead of the stl
* add missing plastic parts to model.
 * feet
 * glass corners
 * filament spool
* model other parts on microextruder
* model the hotend
* put motor, stepper, arduino mount and ssr mount on thingiverse
* add source links for all the parts
* put this on thingiverse
* make x-endstop + on thingiverse
* X-carriage redesign, including:
 * belt clamps and tightener
 * sprung extruder mount with touchdown sensor
 * matches my belt height
 * fan/blower w/ duct
 * place to fit / push x-endstop
* fasteners
* finalize and publish / pull-request openscad gedit syntax highlighter
