#My MendelMax 1.5 and its whole Openscad model

![picture](http://github.com/markfinn/complete_MendelMax1.5/blob/master/mm15_model.png?raw=true "model")

This is all of the parts on my MendelMax in one place and model.  Useful for modeling new parts.

80% of the parts are from the upstream MendelMax design, 10% are from others, 10% from me.

The full openscad model is in mm15_model.scad. Everything else is a part on my machine (but not necessarily my design).

The model is not entirely done yet, but still usefull.

##Todo:
* switch arduino mount to scad use<> instead of the stl
* add missing plastic parts to model.
 * slide support corners
 * feet
 * glass corners
 * filament spool
* orient microextruder and model the motor
* model the hotend
* put motor, stepper, arduino mount and ssr mount on thingiverse
* add source links for all the parts
* put this on thingiverse
* make x-endstop + on thingiverse
* X-carriage redesign, including:
 * belt clamps and tightener
 * sprung extruder mount with touchdown sensor
 * matches my belt height
 * fan/blower w/ duct
* fasteners
* finalize and publish / pull-request openscad gedit syntax highlighter
